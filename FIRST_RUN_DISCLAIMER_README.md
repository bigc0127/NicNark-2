## Implementation Details

### First-Run Detection
```swift
// Uses UserDefaults to track if disclaimer has been shown
UserDefaults.standard.hasShownFirstRunDisclaimer
```

### Presentation Logic
- Shows 0.5 seconds after app launch (ensuring UI is ready)
- Modal presentation prevents app usage until accepted
- Requires explicit scroll and agreement button interaction

### Privacy Disclosures
- No data collection by developer
- Local storage only (Core Data + iCloud sync)
- No third-party analytics or tracking
- No account creation required
- Transparent about data handling

## Key Disclaimer Points for App Store

### Medical Safety
- **NOT medical advice**: Repeatedly emphasized throughout
- **Consult healthcare providers**: Clear direction to professionals
- **Estimates only**: Calculations are not medically accurate
- **No endorsement**: Does not promote nicotine use
- **Health risks**: Acknowledges addiction and health dangers

### Data Privacy (iOS 18+ Requirements)
- **No data collection**: Developer collects nothing
- **Local storage**: All data stays on user's devices
- **iCloud sync**: Only through user's personal Apple account
- **No third parties**: No sharing or selling of data
- **No tracking**: No analytics or user behavior tracking

### Legal Protection
- **Use at own risk**: Users accept responsibility
- **No warranties**: Developer disclaims guarantees
- **Educational only**: Information is for learning purposes
- **Compliance required**: Users must follow local laws
- **Liability limitation**: Developer not responsible for consequences
