## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Timer Configuration (Quick Win)
1. Update SettingsView to include timer picker
2. Test timer changes with existing pouches
3. Verify Live Activities work with new durations

### Phase 2: CSV Export (User Value)
1. Create export functionality
2. Add to Settings
3. Test with various data sizes

### Phase 3: Can Inventory (Major Feature)
1. Update Core Data model
2. Create Can management UI
3. Implement barcode scanning
4. Update LogView interface
5. Handle Siri Shortcuts integration

## Technical Considerations

### Core Data Migration
- Need to add Can entity
- Add optional can relationship to PouchLog
- Create lightweight migration

### Camera Permissions
- Add NSCameraUsageDescription to Info.plist
- Handle permission requests gracefully

### Backwards Compatibility
- Ensure existing shortcuts still work
- Handle logs without can association
- Provide "Ignore Can" option

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Timer changes persist across app launches
- [ ] CSV export includes all historical data
- [ ] Barcode scanning works reliably
- [ ] Can inventory updates correctly
- [ ] Siri Shortcuts handle can prompts
- [ ] Live Activities work with all timer durations
