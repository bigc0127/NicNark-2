# CloudKit Multi-Device Sync Setup

## 📋 What's Implemented

Your app now has full CloudKit synchronization between iPhone and iPad with the following features:

✅ **Data Sync**: All pouch logs and usage data sync automatically between devices
✅ **Live Activity Sync**: Active pouches started on one device will show Live Activities on all devices
✅ **Cross-Device Completion**: When you remove a pouch on one device, Live Activities end on all devices
✅ **Widget Sync**: Home screen widgets show the same data across all devices
✅ **Smart Conflict Resolution**: Automatic merge handling for simultaneous edits

## 🛠 Xcode Project Setup Required

You need to enable CloudKit capability in your Xcode project:

### 1. Enable CloudKit Capability
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your **main app target** (nicnark-2)
3. Go to **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
4. Click **"+ Capability"**
5. Add **"CloudKit"**
6. Ensure the container identifier is: `iCloud.ConnorNeedling.nicnark-2`

### 2. Core Data Model Configuration
✅ Already configured - your `nicnark_2.xcdatamodel` has:
- `usedWithCloudKit="YES"`
- All entities marked as `syncable="YES"`

### 3. Required Settings
Make sure these are enabled in your project:
- **CloudKit capability** on main app target
- **App Groups capability** for widgets (already done)
- **iCloud** capability if not automatically added

## 🔧 How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Local Changes**: When you log/edit/remove a pouch, it saves to Core Data
2. **CloudKit Sync**: Core Data automatically syncs changes to CloudKit
3. **Remote Detection**: Other devices detect CloudKit changes via `NSPersistentStoreRemoteChange`
4. **Live Activity Sync**: The `CloudKitSyncManager` starts/ends Live Activities on all devices
5. **Widget Updates**: Widgets automatically update with the latest synced data

### Key Components
- **`PersistenceController`**: Manages CloudKit-enabled Core Data stack
- **`CloudKitSyncManager`**: Handles cross-device Live Activity synchronization
- **`WidgetPersistenceHelper`**: Keeps widgets in sync with main data

## 📱 Testing Multi-Device Sync

### To Test:
1. **Sign into the same iCloud account** on both iPhone and iPad
2. **Enable iCloud Drive** (required for CloudKit)
3. **Log a pouch on iPhone** → Should appear in iPad's usage graphs
4. **Active pouch Live Activity** should appear on both devices
5. **Remove pouch on iPad** → Live Activity should end on iPhone

### Troubleshooting:
- Check **Console app** for CloudKit sync logs
- Look for **"CloudKit available"** or **"No iCloud account"** messages
- Sync may take a few seconds to propagate between devices
- First sync after install may take longer

## 🎯 Features Working Cross-Device

✅ **Pouch Logging**: Log on iPhone → Shows in iPad usage graphs
✅ **Live Activities**: Active pouch on iPhone → Live Activity appears on iPad  
✅ **Pouch Completion**: Remove pouch on iPad → Live Activity ends on iPhone
✅ **Edit Sync**: Edit pouch start time on iPhone → Updates Live Activity on iPad
✅ **Widget Data**: Home screen widgets show same data on all devices
✅ **Usage Statistics**: All charts and graphs sync between devices

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **First Launch**: May take a few minutes to establish CloudKit sync
- **Network Required**: Sync only works with internet connection
- **iCloud Account**: User must be signed into iCloud for sync to work
- **Storage**: Data counts against user's iCloud storage quota (minimal usage)

Your app now provides a seamless multi-device experience! 🎉
