     * This uses a linear absorption model for the active pouch phase:
     * - Absorption increases steadily from 0% to 30% over FULL_RELEASE_TIME
     * - Maximum 30% of the pouch content gets absorbed (ABSORPTION_FRACTION)
     * 
     * Formula: absorbed(t) = D × A × min(t / FULL_RELEASE_TIME, 1.0)
     * Where:
     * - D = nicotine dose/content of pouch (mg)
     * - A = absorption fraction (0.30 = 30%)
     * - t = time pouch has been in mouth (seconds)
     * - FULL_RELEASE_TIME = configurable duration (30, 45, or 60 minutes)
     * 
     * Example: 6mg pouch after 15 minutes (with 30min FULL_RELEASE_TIME)
     *   = 6 × 0.30 × (15/30) = 6 × 0.30 × 0.5 = 0.9mg absorbed
