/**
 * Extension to the PouchLog Core Data entity for can-related functionality.
 * 
 * The PouchLog entity has a Core Data relationship to Can entities, allowing the app
 * to track which can each pouch came from. This enables:
 * - Inventory tracking (decrementing can pouch counts)
 * - Usage analytics by brand/flavor
 * - Low stock notifications for specific cans
 * 
 * The actual "can" relationship property is auto-generated by Core Data based on
 * the model definition in nicnark_2.xcdatamodeld and appears in PouchLog+CoreDataProperties.swift.

extension PouchLog {
    // Currently no custom methods needed - the Core Data relationship handles everything.
    // Future can-related convenience methods would go here.
